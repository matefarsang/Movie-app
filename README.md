# Movie CRUD Application with Redux & React Query - Next.js

This application displays a movie table with different functions:

We can add a new movie, with the mandatory fields: title, description, age limit

In the table, we can filter the movies by age limit

By clicking on the green icon under the actions menu, we can display the data of the selected movie, which we can update by clicking the yellow (update) button if we wish

We can delete the selected movie from the table with the red trash button.
